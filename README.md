javascript quiz
Updation Done:
index.js file and main.css file  updated by adding a statement to dsplay percentage of the quiz result  to the index.js file
and corresponding css code required is added to main.css.......
now the javascript project is displaying result and percentage both... sorry i ommitted reading the percentage part in the problem statement
so earlier the project i submitted was displaying only result and not the percentage..... 
kindly evaluate the updated version of the project ...
Sorry for the inconvenience....
